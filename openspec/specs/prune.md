# Spec: /wiki prune — LRU-Demote (Index Eviction)

## Description

The prune command keeps two-stage routing precise as the wiki grows by evicting cold
pages from the live hub index. A page is "cold" when it has not been read (logged in
the Access-Log) within a configurable window (default 6 months). Eviction is NOT
deletion and NOT a file move: the page keeps its filename and location, its incoming
`[[links]]` stay valid, and it remains greppable as an L3 fallback. Only its routing
line moves from the hub `### Index` to `### Archive`, and the page is marked
`archived::`. This is the access-frequency eviction layer of the L1/L2/L3 cache model —
the counterpart to query (read path) and ingest (write path).

prune is meant to run on a schedule (default cadence: 6 months). The command itself
does NOT self-schedule; the user wires it via their own scheduler.

`/wiki prune --l1` is a separate mode for L1 memory. Access frequency cannot find stale
L1 rules (every L1 file is loaded every session), so this mode works on claim class and
verification date (specs/l1-l2-routing.md REQ-370-379): it classifies unclassified
files, checks due behavior claims against read-only evidence, and lets the user
re-verify, demote to L2, or delete each one. `--l1` does NOT run the L2 index eviction,
and plain `/wiki prune` does NOT touch L1.

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Access Profile

- REQ-600: The system SHALL read `llm-wiki.yml` first to determine tool mode, wiki
  path, and memory path.
- REQ-601: The system SHALL read the Access-Log page (`Wiki/Reference/Access-Log`) and
  determine the last-access date per page from its newest log entry.
- REQ-602: For a page that has never been logged, the system SHALL use its `created::`
  date as the last-access proxy.
- REQ-603: The cold threshold SHALL be "no access in N months", where N defaults to 6
  and is overridable via `--months N`.
- REQ-604: The system SHALL EXEMPT from demotion: hub pages (type hub), the Schema page,
  the Dashboard page, the Access-Log page, and any page with `status:: active` that is
  a project (in-flight work is never evicted, even if unread).

### Phase 2: Demote Candidates

- REQ-610: The system SHALL list demote candidates (page — last-access date — age in
  months) and present them to the user BEFORE any write. Demotion is opt-in.
- REQ-611: For each confirmed candidate, the system SHALL add the property
  `archived:: <today>` — the canonical demoted marker, valid on any page type (see
  specs/schema.md REQ-565). It MUST NOT modify `created::` or `updated::`.
- REQ-612: For pages whose `status` enum includes `archived` (Entity), the system
  SHOULD also set `status:: archived`. For types whose enum does NOT (Project,
  Knowledge), the system MUST NOT set an out-of-enum `status` value.
- REQ-613: The system SHALL move the page's routing line from the hub `### Index` to
  the hub `### Archive` section VERBATIM (move, not delete).
- REQ-614: The system MUST NOT rename the page or move its file to another namespace.
  The tool links by page name; a move would break every incoming `[[link]]`.
- REQ-615: After demotion, all incoming `[[links]]` to the page SHALL remain valid and
  the page SHALL remain readable via the L3 grep fallback in query.

### Phase 3: Report + Commit

- REQ-620: The system SHALL report the demoted list, the new live-index size per
  namespace, and the hot pages (top access count) for contrast.
- REQ-621: The system SHALL create a git commit for the structural change (hub index
  edits + page property changes). This commit also carries any pending Access-Log
  appends (which are non-structural and not committed per-query).
- REQ-622: The system SHALL note when the next prune is due (N months out). It MUST NOT
  create a scheduler entry itself.

### L1 Mode (`--l1`)

#### Phase L1-1: Scope

- REQ-900: `/wiki prune --l1` SHALL require `memory_path`. If it is absent, the system
  SHALL display "memory_path not configured — L1 mode unavailable." and abort.
- REQ-901: The system SHALL skip the L1 index file (specs/l1-l2-routing.md REQ-377).
- REQ-902: The batch size SHALL default to 10 and be overridable via `--batch N`. The
  verification window SHALL default to `l1_verify_days` and be overridable via
  `--days N`.
- REQ-903: Every write in L1 mode SHALL require confirmation. L1 is not git-tracked:
  there is no undo. Before any delete or demote, the system SHALL show a carry-over
  summary: what the L2 history block keeps, what is dropped (and why), and the path to
  the file so the user can read it in full. For files of a few lines, the full content
  MAY be shown instead.

#### Phase L1-2: Classify

- REQ-905: For up to one batch of unclassified files, the system SHALL propose a value
  for `asserts-current-behavior` (true/false) with a one-line reason per file, applying
  the definitions in specs/l1-l2-routing.md REQ-371-372.
- REQ-906: The user SHALL be able to confirm the whole batch or override individual
  proposals. Only confirmed values SHALL be written (specs/l1-l2-routing.md REQ-376 placement rules apply).
- REQ-907: Classification MUST NOT set `verified`. A newly classified behavior claim
  is due until evidence has been checked.
- REQ-908: A file whose content is mixed (a decision plus a behavior claim) SHOULD be
  classified `true` and the proposal SHOULD suggest splitting it into two files.

#### Phase L1-3: Gather Evidence

- REQ-910: For each due rule (up to one batch, oldest `verified` first, never-verified
  before dated), the system SHALL extract the concrete, checkable elements the rule
  names: file paths, commands, flags, versions, ports, config keys, URLs.
- REQ-911: Evidence gathering MUST be read-only: checking file existence, reading
  files, searching file contents, reading dependency manifests, and running commands
  only with read-only informational flags (`--version`, `--help`). The system MUST NOT
  run commands with side effects, write to disk, deploy, or change remote state.
- REQ-912: The system SHALL report a verdict — `supports`, `contradicts`, or
  `inconclusive` — per checkable claim in the rule, with the evidence behind it (what
  was checked, what was found). A rule usually makes several claims.
- REQ-912a: The rule's overall verdict SHALL be `contradicts` if any claim contradicts,
  `supports` if all checked claims support, and `inconclusive` otherwise. A partial
  verdict (some claims unchecked) SHALL be marked as partial and name the unchecked claims.
- REQ-912b: Each piece of evidence SHALL state its basis: `executed` (read-only command
  output), `source` (read the implementing code, not run), or `file` (existence or content
  of a file). Behavior that can only be observed with side effects SHALL be checked via
  `source` or reported `inconclusive`, never executed.
- REQ-913: A rule whose elements cannot be checked locally (external service behavior,
  pricing, third-party policy) SHALL be reported `inconclusive` with the reason
  "not locally verifiable". The system MUST NOT fetch remote content to decide.
- REQ-914: Evidence output MUST NOT include credential values. For a rule that holds
  a credential, the system SHALL report only whether the referenced location exists.
- REQ-915: The system MUST NOT decide on its own. A verdict is input for the user,
  not an action.

#### Phase L1-4: Act (per rule, user choice)

- REQ-920: The system SHALL offer three actions per due rule: **re-verify**, **demote
  to L2**, **delete**. It SHALL recommend one based on the verdict: `supports` →
  re-verify; `contradicts` → demote (history still useful) or delete; `inconclusive`
  → re-verify only if the user confirms the claim from their own knowledge.
- REQ-921: **Re-verify** SHALL set `verified: <today>`. If the verdict is
  `contradicts`, re-verify SHALL only be offered together with a proposed corrected
  rule text, and both SHALL be written together on confirmation. The correction SHALL
  cover every place the contradicted claim appears: the body, the frontmatter
  `description` (it is loaded via the index), and the rule's line in the L1 index file.
- REQ-922: **Demote to L2** SHALL route the rule's content through the normal ingest
  path (specs/ingest.md): append it as a history block to the most relevant wiki page
  found via hub-index routing, or create a page if none fits. The block SHALL carry
  `source:: l1-demotion` and the date. Only after the wiki write succeeds SHALL the
  system delete the L1 file and remove its line from the L1 index file.
- REQ-923: A rule containing a credential MUST NOT be demoted to L2
  (specs/l1-l2-routing.md REQ-312). Only re-verify and delete SHALL be offered.
- REQ-924: **Delete** SHALL remove the L1 file and its line from the L1 index file.
- REQ-925: Choosing none of the three (skip) SHALL leave the file untouched; it stays
  due and reappears in the next run.
- REQ-926: Before removing an L1 file (demote or delete), the system SHALL search the
  other L1 files and the L1 index file for references to it (file name and frontmatter
  `name`). On demote, references SHALL be rewritten to point to the L2 page; on delete,
  they SHALL be listed for the user and removed or rewritten on confirmation. If the
  index line points to more than one file, only the removed file's pointer SHALL be
  taken out, and the line SHALL be shown before and after.

#### Phase L1-5: Report + Commit

- REQ-928: The system SHALL report counts: classified (true/false), re-verified,
  demoted, deleted, skipped, and remaining unclassified and due files.
- REQ-929: The system SHALL create a git commit for wiki pages changed by demotion
  (plus pending Access-Log appends). L1 changes are not committed (L1 is git-excluded,
  specs/l1-l2-routing.md REQ-330).

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cold page demoted

```
GIVEN Wiki/Tech/Legacy-Foo was last logged in the Access-Log on 2025-09-01
AND today is 2026-06-07 (≈ 9 months, exceeds the 6-month threshold)
AND it is a knowledge page (not a hub, not active project, not Schema/Dashboard/Access-Log)
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune
THEN the system SHALL list Wiki/Tech/Legacy-Foo as a demote candidate (last access 2025-09-01, 9 mo)
AND on confirmation SHALL add archived:: 2026-06-07 to the page (created::/updated:: unchanged)
AND move its routing line from the Wiki/Tech hub `### Index` to `### Archive`
AND NOT rename or move the page file
AND commit the change
```

### Scenario 2: Never-accessed page uses created date

```
GIVEN Wiki/Learning/Old-Course has no Access-Log entries
AND its created:: date is 2025-08-01 (older than 6 months)
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune
THEN the system SHALL treat 2025-08-01 as its last-access proxy
AND list it as a demote candidate
```

### Scenario 3: Active project exempt

```
GIVEN Wiki/Projects/Big-Migration has status:: active
AND it has not been read in 8 months
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune
THEN the system SHALL NOT list it as a demote candidate (active projects are exempt)
```

### Scenario 4: Custom window

```
GIVEN several pages last accessed between 3 and 5 months ago
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune --months 3
THEN the system SHALL list every page with no access in the last 3 months as a candidate
```

### Scenario 5: Re-promotion is handled by query, not prune

```
GIVEN Wiki/Tech/Legacy-Foo is demoted (archived::, routing line in `### Archive`)
WHEN a later /wiki query L3 grep matches it and reads it in full
THEN re-promotion is offered by the query command (specs/query.md REQ-452), NOT prune
AND prune SHALL never auto-promote pages
```

### Scenario 6: Demotion preserves incoming links

```
GIVEN Wiki/Projects/Acme links to [[Wiki/Tech/Legacy-Foo]]
WHEN Wiki/Tech/Legacy-Foo is demoted by /wiki prune
THEN the [[Wiki/Tech/Legacy-Foo]] link in Wiki/Projects/Acme SHALL still resolve
AND lint SHALL NOT report it as a broken reference
```

### Scenario 7: Obsidian mode

```
GIVEN llm-wiki.yml is configured with tool: obsidian
AND Wiki/Tech/Legacy-Foo.md is a cold page
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune
THEN the system SHALL add archived: <today> to the YAML frontmatter
AND move the routing line within the Wiki/Tech hub (Wiki/Tech/_index.md) from
    `### Index` to `### Archive`
AND keep the file at Wiki/Tech/Legacy-Foo.md (no move)
```

### Scenario 8: L1 classification batch

```
GIVEN memory_path holds 25 unclassified L1 files
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune --l1
THEN the system SHALL propose asserts-current-behavior values for 10 files, each with a reason
    e.g. "feedback_pm2_reload.md → true (claims PM2 reload fails with npm start)"
         "feedback_no_ai_attribution.md → false (records a preference)"
AND on confirmation SHALL write only the key, without verified
AND report 15 files still unclassified
```

### Scenario 9: Evidence contradicts a rule

```
GIVEN feedback_hook_path.md (asserts-current-behavior: true, verified: 2026-02-01) says
    "the hook lives at ~/.claude/hooks/rtk-rewrite.sh"
AND that path does not exist, but settings.json references ~/Projekte/tools/rtk/hooks/rtk-rewrite.sh
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune --l1
THEN the system SHALL report verdict contradicts, with both paths as evidence
AND recommend demote or delete
AND offer re-verify only together with a corrected rule text naming the new path
AND write nothing until the user chooses
```

### Scenario 10: Not locally verifiable

```
GIVEN reference_hosting_prices.md (asserts-current-behavior: true, no verified) states a monthly price
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune --l1
THEN the system SHALL report verdict inconclusive — "not locally verifiable"
AND NOT fetch the provider website
```

### Scenario 11: Demote to L2

```
GIVEN feedback_old_deploy_flow.md is due and the verdict is contradicts
AND the user chooses demote
WHEN the system executes the action
THEN it SHALL show a carry-over summary (kept in L2 / dropped and why / file path) first
AND append a history block with source:: l1-demotion to the page routed via the hub index
    (e.g. Wiki/Tech/Deployment)
AND only then delete feedback_old_deploy_flow.md and its MEMORY.md line
AND commit the wiki change
```

### Scenario 12: Credential rule cannot be demoted

```
GIVEN reference_strapi_credentials.md is due
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune --l1
THEN the evidence SHALL show only whether the referenced location exists, never the value
AND the offered actions SHALL be re-verify and delete only
```

### Scenario 12b: Partial verdict with evidence basis

```
GIVEN feedback_e2e_gotchas.md claims (a) `data/` in .gitignore also matches lib/data/,
    (b) a fresh worktree lacks public/clients/logo.svg, (c) a proxy rewrites `next start`
AND .gitignore contains `data/`, public/clients/logo.svg no longer exists anywhere,
    and (c) can only be observed by starting a server
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune --l1
THEN the system SHALL report (a) supports [file], (b) contradicts [file], (c) unchecked
AND the overall verdict SHALL be contradicts (partial), naming claim (b) and unchecked (c)
AND the proposed correction SHALL change the body, the description, and the index line
```

### Scenario 12c: References are rewritten on demote

```
GIVEN project_x_status.md is demoted to Wiki/Projects/X
AND feedback_lighthouse.md contains "Related: [[project_x_status]]"
WHEN the L1 file is removed
THEN the reference SHALL be rewritten to [[Wiki/Projects/X]]
AND the MEMORY.md pointer to project_x_status.md SHALL be removed
```

### Scenario 13: Modes are separate

```
GIVEN cold L2 pages and due L1 rules both exist
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune
THEN only L2 index eviction SHALL run
WHEN the user runs /wiki prune --l1
THEN only L1 classification and verification SHALL run
```

## Dependencies

- `llm-wiki.yml` must exist and be valid (see specs/config.md)
- specs/schema.md defines the `archived::` marker, the hub `### Index`/`### Archive`
  structure, and the Access-Log page
- specs/query.md writes the Access-Log this command consumes and owns re-promotion
- specs/lint.md rules 10-11 detect index drift and archived-in-live-index left by an
  interrupted prune
- specs/l1-l2-routing.md REQ-370-379 define claim class, verification date, and due rules
  for `--l1`; specs/lint.md Rule 12 reports them; specs/config.md REQ-660 sets the window
- specs/ingest.md is reused by the demote-to-L2 action
